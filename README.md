# LSTM_SELFDRIVINGCAR
A ConvLSTM2D network, that implements sequence learning too udacictys selfdrivingcar simulator project

This code is based around Nvidias selfdriving car project where they open sourced their code, they made a Convulotional neural network or also called CNN which managed too make the simulating car drive on the track, but CNN networks are normally used too analyze images and find special patterns in these images, just like the human brain. For driving there is more too it then just analyzing what you see right here and know, driving is a sequence of many images that you analyze, and CNN networks have no memory therefore they cant analyze sequences. That is why i have implemented LSTM celles into this model, beacuse LSTM stands for long short-term memory, which means that LSTM cells are cabale of analyzing sequences and long sequences. With the help of keras it is possible to combine CNN's and LSTM cells together with there ConvLSTM2D layers, which is what i used in this code. I don't own powerfull enough hardware too train this model, but with some tweaks and training this model and analyzing the resuluts, i should be possible to achieve a more realistic driving method with this model, then nvidias model from 2016
